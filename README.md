## Docker configuration for laravel

This is helper for simple multisite docker configuration with Nginx, php-fpm, redis, mysql
I configured my environment with this files, so they should work.
Be careful with .env file and redis, I struggled with this one, that's why I created environment variables in php container.
Feel free to tweak the conf files to get more detailed configuration.
